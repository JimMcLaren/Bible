<h2>Psalm 12</h2>
<p class="psasuper">For the music director, according to the <i>sheminith</i> style; a psalm of David.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">1</span> Deliver, <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>!</p>
<p class="poetry">For the godly have disappeared; </p>
<p class="poetry">people of integrity have vanished. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">2</span> People lie to one another; </p>
<p class="poetry">they flatter and deceive. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3</span> May the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> cut off all flattering lips,</p>
<p class="poetry">and the tongue that boasts! </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">4</span> They say, “We speak persuasively; </p>
<p class="poetry">we know how to flatter and boast. </p>
<p class="poetry">Who is our master?” </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">5</span> “Because of the violence done to the oppressed, </p>
<p class="poetry">because of the painful cries of the needy,</p>
<p class="poetry">I will spring into action,” says the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="poetry">“I will provide the safety they so desperately desire.” </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">6</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s words are absolutely reliable. </p>
<p class="poetry">They are as untainted as silver purified in a furnace on the ground,</p>
<p class="poetry">where it is thoroughly refined. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">7</span> You, <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, will protect them; </p>
<p class="poetry">you will continually shelter each one from these evil people, </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">8</span> for the wicked seem to be everywhere, </p>
<p class="poetry">when people promote evil. </p>
