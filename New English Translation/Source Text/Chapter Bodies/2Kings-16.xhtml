<h1>2 Kings<br/>Chapter 16</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Ahaz’s Reign over Judah</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">1</span> In the seventeenth year of the reign of Pekah son of Remaliah, Jotham’s son Ahaz became king over Judah. <span class="verse">2</span> Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do what pleased the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> his God, in contrast to his ancestor David. <span class="verse">3</span> He followed in the footsteps of the kings of Israel. He passed his son through the fire, a horrible sin practiced by the nations whom the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> drove out from before the Israelites. <span class="verse">4</span> He offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">5</span> At that time King Rezin of Syria and King Pekah son of Remaliah of Israel attacked Jerusalem. They besieged Ahaz, but were unable to conquer him. <span class="verse">6</span> (At that time King Rezin of Syria recovered Elat for Syria; he drove the Judahites from there. Syrians arrived in Elat and live there to this very day.) <span class="verse">7</span> Ahaz sent messengers to King Tiglath-Pileser of Assyria, saying, “I am your servant and your dependent. March up and rescue me from the power of the king of Syria and the king of Israel, who have attacked me.” <span class="verse">8</span> Then Ahaz took the silver and gold that were in the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s temple and in the treasuries of the royal palace and sent it as tribute to the king of Assyria. <span class="verse">9</span> The king of Assyria responded favorably to his request; he attacked Damascus and captured it. He deported the people to Kir and executed Rezin. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">10</span> When King Ahaz went to meet with King Tiglath-Pileser of Assyria in Damascus, he saw the altar there. King Ahaz sent to Uriah the priest a drawing of the altar and a blueprint for its design. <span class="verse">11</span> Uriah the priest built an altar in conformity to the plans King Ahaz had sent from Damascus. Uriah the priest finished it before King Ahaz arrived back from Damascus. <span class="verse">12</span> When the king arrived back from Damascus and saw the altar, he approached it and offered a sacrifice on it. <span class="verse">13</span> He offered his burnt sacrifice and his grain offering. He poured out his libation and sprinkled the blood from his peace offerings on the altar. <span class="verse">14</span> He moved the bronze altar that stood in the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s presence from the front of the temple (between the altar and the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s temple) and put it on the north side of the new altar. <span class="verse">15</span> King Ahaz ordered Uriah the priest, “On the large altar offer the morning burnt sacrifice, the evening grain offering, the royal burnt sacrifices and grain offering, the burnt sacrifice for all the people of the land, their grain offering, and their libations. Sprinkle all the blood of the burnt sacrifice and other sacrifices on it. The bronze altar will be for my personal use.” <span class="verse">16</span> So Uriah the priest did exactly as King Ahaz ordered. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">17</span> King Ahaz took off the frames of the movable stands, and removed the basins from them. He took “The Sea” down from the bronze bulls that supported it and put it on the stone pavement. <span class="verse">18</span> He also removed the Sabbath awning that had been built in the temple and the king’s outer entranceway to the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s temple, on account of the king of Assyria. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">19</span> The rest of the events of Ahaz’s reign, including his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Judah. <span class="verse">20</span> Ahaz passed away and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. His son Hezekiah replaced him as king. </p>
