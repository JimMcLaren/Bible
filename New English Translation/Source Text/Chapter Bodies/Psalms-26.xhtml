<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3</span> For I am ever aware of your faithfulness, </p>
<p class="poetry">and your loyalty continually motivates me. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">4</span> I do not associate with deceitful men,</p>
<p class="poetry">or consort with those who are dishonest. </p>

<p class="poetry">and do not associate with the wicked. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">6</span> I maintain a pure lifestyle, </p>

<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">7</span> to give you thanks, </p>
<p class="poetry">and to tell about all your amazing deeds. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">8</span> O <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, I love the temple where you live, </p>
<p class="poetry">the place where your splendor is revealed. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">9</span> Do not sweep me away with sinners,</p>
<p class="poetry">or execute me along with violent people, </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">10</span> who are always ready to do wrong </p>
<p class="poetry">or offer a bribe. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">11</span> But I have integrity. </p>
<p class="poetry">Rescue me and have mercy on me!</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">12</span> I am safe, </p>
<p class="poetry">and among the worshipers I will praise the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>. </p>
