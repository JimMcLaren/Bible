<h2>Psalm 133</h2>
<p class="psasuper">A song of ascents; by David.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">1</span> Look! How good and how pleasant it is</p>
<p class="poetry">when brothers truly live in unity. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">2</span> It is like fine oil poured on the head,</p>
<p class="poetry">which flows down the beard —</p>
<p class="poetry">Aaron’s beard,</p>
<p class="poetry">and then flows down his garments. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3</span> It is like the dew of Hermon, </p>
<p class="poetry">which flows down upon the hills of Zion. </p>
<p class="poetry">Indeed, that is where the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> has decreed</p>
<p class="poetry">a blessing will be available—eternal life. </p>
