<p class="poetry">you purified us like refined silver. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">11</span> You led us into a trap; </p>
<p class="poetry">you caused us to suffer. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">12</span> You allowed men to ride over our heads;</p>
<p class="poetry">we passed through fire and water,</p>
<p class="poetry">but you brought us out into a wide open place. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">13</span> I will enter your temple with burnt sacrifices;</p>
<p class="poetry">I will fulfill the vows I made to you,</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">14</span> which my lips uttered</p>
<p class="poetry">and my mouth spoke when I was in trouble. </p>

<p class="poetry">along with the smell of sacrificial rams.</p>
<p class="poetry">I will offer cattle and goats. (Selah)</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">16</span> Come! Listen, all you who are loyal to God. </p>
<p class="poetry">I will declare what he has done for me. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">17</span> I cried out to him for help </p>
<p class="poetry">and praised him with my tongue. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">18</span> If I had harbored sin in my heart, </p>
<p class="poetry">the Lord would not have listened. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">19</span> However, God heard;</p>
<p class="poetry">he listened to my prayer. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">20</span> God deserves praise, </p>
<p class="poetry">for he did not reject my prayer</p>
<p class="poetry">or abandon his love for me. </p>
