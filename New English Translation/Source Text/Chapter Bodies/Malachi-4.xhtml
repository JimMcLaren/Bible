<h1>Malachi<br/>Chapter 4</h1>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">1</span> (3:19) “For indeed the day is coming, burning like a furnace, and all the arrogant evildoers will be chaff. The coming day will burn them up,” says the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies. “It will not leave them even a root or branch. <span class="verse">2</span> But for you who respect my name, the sun of vindication will rise with healing wings, and you will skip about like calves released from the stall. <span class="verse">3</span> You will trample on the wicked, for they will be like ashes under the soles of your feet on the day that I am preparing,” says the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies. </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Restoration through the Lord</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">4</span> “Remember the law of my servant Moses, to whom at Horeb I gave rules and regulations for all Israel to obey. <span class="verse">5</span> Look, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> arrives. <span class="verse">6</span> He will encourage fathers and their children to return to me, so that I will not come and strike the earth with judgment.” </p>
