<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">2</span> When evil men attack me </p>

<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">4</span> I have asked the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> for one thing—</p>
<p class="poetry">this is what I desire!</p>
<p class="poetry">I want to live in the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s house all the days of my life,</p>
<p class="poetry">so I can gaze at the splendor of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span></p>
<p class="poetry">and contemplate in his temple. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">5</span> He will surely give me shelter in the day of danger; </p>
