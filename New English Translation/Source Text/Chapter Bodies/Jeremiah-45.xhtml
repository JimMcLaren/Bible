<h1>Jeremiah<br/>Chapter 45</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Baruch is Rebuked but also Comforted</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">1</span> The prophet Jeremiah spoke to Baruch son of Neriah while he was writing down in a scroll the words that Jeremiah spoke to him. (This happened in the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was ruling over Judah.) <span class="verse">2</span> Jeremiah said, “The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> God of Israel has a message for you, Baruch. <span class="verse">3</span> ‘You have said, “I feel so hopeless! For the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> has added sorrow to my suffering. I am worn out from groaning. I can’t find any rest.”’” </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">4</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> told Jeremiah, “Tell Baruch, ‘The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> says, “I am about to tear down what I have built and to uproot what I have planted. I will do this throughout the whole earth. <span class="verse">5</span> Are you looking for great things for yourself? Do not look for such things. For I, the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, affirm that I am about to bring disaster on all humanity. But I will allow you to escape with your life wherever you go.”’” </p>
