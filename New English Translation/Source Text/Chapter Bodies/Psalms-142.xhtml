<h2>Psalm 142</h2>
<p class="psasuper">A well-written song by David, when he was in the cave; a prayer.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">1</span> To the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> I cry out; </p>
<p class="poetry">to the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> I plead for mercy. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">2</span> I pour out my lament before him;</p>
<p class="poetry">I tell him about my troubles. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3</span> Even when my strength leaves me, </p>
<p class="poetry">you watch my footsteps. </p>
<p class="poetry">In the path where I walk</p>
<p class="poetry">they have hidden a trap for me.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">4</span> Look to the right and see.</p>
<p class="poetry">No one cares about me. </p>
<p class="poetry">I have nowhere to run; </p>
<p class="poetry">no one is concerned about my life. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">5</span> I cry out to you, O <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>;</p>
<p class="poetry">I say, “You are my shelter,</p>
<p class="poetry">my security in the land of the living.” </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">6</span> Listen to my cry for help,</p>
<p class="poetry">for I am in serious trouble. </p>
<p class="poetry">Rescue me from those who chase me,</p>
<p class="poetry">for they are stronger than I am.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">7</span> Free me from prison,</p>
<p class="poetry">that I may give thanks to your name.</p>
<p class="poetry">Because of me the godly will assemble, </p>
<p class="poetry">for you will vindicate me. </p>
