<h1>Luke<br/>Chapter 18:15-43</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Jesus and Little Children </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">15</span> Now people were even bringing their babies to him for him to touch. But when the disciples saw it, they began to scold those who brought them. <span class="verse">16</span> But Jesus called for the children, saying, “Let the little children come to me and do not try to stop them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. <span class="verse">17</span> I tell you the truth, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will never enter it.” </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">The Wealthy Ruler </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">18</span> Now a certain leader asked him, “Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” <span class="verse">19</span> Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. <span class="verse">20</span> You know the commandments: ‘<b><i>Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother</i></b>.’” <span class="verse">21</span> The man replied, “I have wholeheartedly obeyed all these laws since my youth.” <span class="verse">22</span> When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.” <span class="verse">23</span> But when the man heard this he became very sad, for he was extremely wealthy. <span class="verse">24</span> When Jesus noticed this, he said, “How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God! <span class="verse">25</span> In fact, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.” <span class="verse">26</span> Those who heard this said, “Then who can be saved?” <span class="verse">27</span> He replied, “What is impossible for mere humans is possible for God.” <span class="verse">28</span> And Peter said, “Look, we have left everything we own to follow you! <span class="verse">29</span> Then Jesus said to them, “I tell you the truth, there is no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of God’s kingdom <span class="verse">30</span> who will not receive many times more in this age —and in the age to come, eternal life.” </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Another Prediction of Jesus’ Passion </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">31</span> Then Jesus took the twelve aside and said to them, “Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished. <span class="verse">32</span> For he will be handed over to the Gentiles; he will be mocked, mistreated, and spat on. <span class="verse">33</span> They will flog him severely and kill him. Yet on the third day he will rise again.” <span class="verse">34</span> But the twelve understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they did not grasp what Jesus meant. </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Healing a Blind Man </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">35</span> As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the road begging. <span class="verse">36</span> When he heard a crowd going by, he asked what was going on. <span class="verse">37</span> They told him, “Jesus the Nazarene is passing by.” <span class="verse">38</span> So he called out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” <span class="verse">39</span> And those who were in front scolded him to get him to be quiet, but he shouted even more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” <span class="verse">40</span> So Jesus stopped and ordered the beggar to be brought to him. When the man came near, Jesus asked him, <span class="verse">41</span> “What do you want me to do for you?” He replied, “Lord, let me see again.” <span class="verse">42</span> Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight; your faith has healed you.” <span class="verse">43</span> And immediately he regained his sight and followed Jesus, praising God. When all the people saw it, they too gave praise to God. </p>
