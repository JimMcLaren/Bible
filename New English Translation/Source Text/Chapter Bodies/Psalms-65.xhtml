<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">2</span> You hear prayers; </p>
<p class="poetry">all people approach you. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3</span> Our record of sins overwhelms me, </p>
<p class="poetry">but you forgive our acts of rebellion. </p>

<p class="poetry">your holy palace. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">5</span> You answer our prayers by performing awesome acts of deliverance,</p>

<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">6</span> You created the mountains by your power, </p>
<p class="poetry">and demonstrated your strength. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">7</span> You calmed the raging seas </p>
<p class="poetry">and their roaring waves,</p>
<p class="poetry">as well as the commotion made by the nations. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">8</span> Even those living in the remotest areas are awestruck by your acts; </p>

<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">9</span> You visit the earth and give it rain; </p>
<p class="poetry">you make it rich and fertile. </p>
<p class="poetry">God’s streams are full of water; </p>
<p class="poetry">you provide grain for the people of the earth, </p>
<p class="poetry">for you have prepared the earth in this way. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">10</span> You saturate its furrows,</p>
<p class="poetry">and soak its plowed ground. </p>
<p class="poetry">With rain showers you soften its soil, </p>
<p class="poetry">and make its crops grow. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">11</span> You crown the year with your good blessings, </p>
<p class="poetry">and you leave abundance in your wake. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">12</span> The pastures in the wilderness glisten with moisture, </p>
<p class="poetry">and the hills are clothed with joy. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">13</span> The meadows are clothed with sheep,</p>
<p class="poetry">and the valleys are covered with grain.</p>
<p class="poetry">They shout joyfully, yes, they sing. </p>
