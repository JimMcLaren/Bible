<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">2</span> My God, I cry out during the day,</p>
<p class="poetry">but you do not answer,</p>
<p class="poetry">and during the night my prayers do not let up. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3</span> You are holy;</p>

<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">7</span> All who see me taunt me;</p>
<p class="poetry">they mock me and shake their heads. </p>

<p class="poetry">“Commit yourself to the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>!</p>
<p class="poetry">Let the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> rescue him!</p>
<p class="poetry">Let the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> deliver him, for he delights in him.” </p>

<p class="poetry">and made me feel secure on my mother’s breasts. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">10</span> I have been dependent on you since birth; </p>
<p class="poetry">from the time I came out of my mother’s womb you have been my God. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">11</span> Do not remain far away from me,</p>
<p class="poetry">for trouble is near and I have no one to help me. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">12</span> Many bulls surround me;</p>
<p class="poetry">powerful bulls of Bashan hem me in.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">13</span> They open their mouths to devour me </p>
<p class="poetry">like a roaring lion that rips its prey. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">14</span> My strength drains away like water; </p>
<p class="poetry">all my bones are dislocated.</p>
<p class="poetry">My heart is like wax;</p>
<p class="poetry">it melts away inside me.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">15</span> The roof of my mouth is as dry as a piece of pottery;</p>
<p class="poetry">my tongue sticks to my gums. </p>
<p class="poetry">You set me in the dust of death. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">16</span> Yes, wild dogs surround me—</p>
<p class="poetry">a gang of evil men crowd around me;</p>
<p class="poetry">like a lion they pin my hands and feet. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">17</span> I can count all my bones;</p>
<p class="poetry">my enemies are gloating over me in triumph. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">18</span> They are dividing up my clothes among themselves;</p>
<p class="poetry">they are rolling dice for my garments. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">19</span> But you, O <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, do not remain far away.</p>
<p class="poetry">You are my source of strength. Hurry and help me! </p>

<p class="poetry">You have answered me. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">22</span> I will declare your name to my countrymen. </p>
<p class="poetry">In the middle of the assembly I will praise you.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">23</span> You loyal followers of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, praise him.</p>
<p class="poetry">All you descendants of Jacob, honor him.</p>
<p class="poetry">All you descendants of Israel, stand in awe of him. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">24</span> For he did not despise or detest the suffering of the oppressed. </p>
<p class="poetry">He did not ignore him; </p>
<p class="poetry">when he cried out to him, he responded. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">25</span> You are the reason I offer praise in the great assembly;</p>
<p class="poetry">I will fulfill my promises before the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s loyal followers. </p>
