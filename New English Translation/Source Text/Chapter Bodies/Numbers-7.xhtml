<h1>Numbers<br/>Chapter 7</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">The Leader’s Offerings</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">1</span>  When Moses had completed setting up the tabernacle, he anointed it and consecrated it and all its furnishings, and he anointed and consecrated the altar and all its utensils. <span class="verse">2</span> Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of their clans, made an offering. They were the leaders of the tribes; they were the ones who had been supervising the numbering. <span class="verse">3</span> They brought their offerings before the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, six covered carts and twelve oxen—one cart for every two of the leaders, and an ox for each one; and they presented them in front of the tabernacle. </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">The Distribution of the Gifts</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">4</span> Then the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> spoke to Moses: <span class="verse">5</span> “Receive these gifts from them, that they may be used in doing the work of the tent of meeting; and you must give them to the Levites, to every man as his service requires.” </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">6</span> So Moses accepted the carts and the oxen and gave them to the Levites. <span class="verse">7</span> He gave two carts and four oxen to the Gershonites, as their service required; <span class="verse">8</span> and he gave four carts and eight oxen to the Merarites, as their service required, under the authority of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest. <span class="verse">9</span> But to the Kohathites he gave none, because the service of the holy things, which they carried on their shoulders, was their responsibility. </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">The Time of Presentation</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">10</span> The leaders offered gifts for the dedication of the altar when it was anointed. And the leaders presented their offering before the altar. <span class="verse">11</span> For the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> said to Moses, “They must present their offering, one leader for each day, for the dedication of the altar.” </p>
