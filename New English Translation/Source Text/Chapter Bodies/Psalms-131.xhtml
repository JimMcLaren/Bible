<h2>Psalm 131</h2>
<p class="psasuper">A song of ascents, by David.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">1</span> O <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, my heart is not proud,</p>
<p class="poetry">nor do I have a haughty look. </p>
<p class="poetry">I do not have great aspirations,</p>
<p class="poetry">or concern myself with things that are beyond me. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">2</span> Indeed, I have calmed and quieted myself </p>
<p class="poetry">like a weaned child with its mother; </p>
<p class="poetry">I am content like a young child. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3</span> O Israel, hope in the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span></p>
<p class="poetry">now and forevermore! </p>
