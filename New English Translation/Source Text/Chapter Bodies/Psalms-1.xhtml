<h2>Psalm 1</h2>
<p class="paragraphtitle"><b>Book 1(Psalms 1-41)</b></p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">1</span> How blessed is the one who does not follow the advice of the wicked, </p>
<p class="poetry">or stand in the pathway with sinners,</p>
<p class="poetry">or sit in the assembly of scoffers. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">2</span> Instead he finds pleasure in obeying the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>â€™s commands; </p>
<p class="poetry">he meditates on his commands day and night. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">3</span> He is like a tree planted by flowing streams; </p>
<p class="poetry">it yields its fruit at the proper time, </p>
<p class="poetry">and its leaves never fall off. </p>
<p class="poetry">He succeeds in everything he attempts. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">4</span> Not so with the wicked!</p>
<p class="poetry">Instead they are like wind-driven chaff. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">5</span> For this reason the wicked cannot withstand judgment, </p>
<p class="poetry">nor can sinners join the assembly of the godly. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="verse">6</span> Certainly the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> guards the way of the godly, </p>
<p class="poetry">but the way of the wicked ends in destruction. </p>
