<h1>Matthew<br/>Chapter 8:14-34</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Healings at Peter’s House </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">14</span> Now when Jesus entered Peter’s house, he saw his mother-in-law lying down, sick with a fever. <span class="verse">15</span> He touched her hand, and the fever left her. Then she got up and began to serve them. <span class="verse">16</span> When it was evening, many demon-possessed people were brought to him. He drove out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick. <span class="verse">17</span> In this way what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah was fulfilled: </p>
<p class="otpoetry">“<i><b>He took our weaknesses and carried our diseases</b></i>.” </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Challenging Professed Followers </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">18</span> Now when Jesus saw a large crowd around him, he gave orders to go to the other side of the lake. <span class="verse">19</span> Then an expert in the law came to him and said, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.” <span class="verse">20</span> Jesus said to him, “Foxes have dens, and the birds in the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.” <span class="verse">21</span> Another of the disciples said to him, “Lord, let me first go and bury my father.” <span class="verse">22</span> But Jesus said to him, “Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.” </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Stilling of a Storm </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">23</span> As he got into the boat, his disciples followed him. <span class="verse">24</span> And a great storm developed on the sea so that the waves began to swamp the boat. But he was asleep. <span class="verse">25</span> So they came and woke him up saying, “Lord, save us! We are about to die!” <span class="verse">26</span> But he said to them, “Why are you cowardly, you people of little faith?” Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and it was dead calm. <span class="verse">27</span> And the men were amazed and said, “What sort of person is this? Even the winds and the sea obey him!” </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Healing the Gadarene Demoniacs </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">28</span> When he came to the other side, to the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him. They were extremely violent, so that no one was able to pass by that way. <span class="verse">29</span> They cried out, “Son of God, leave us alone! Have you come here to torment us before the time?” <span class="verse">30</span> A large herd of pigs was feeding some distance from them. <span class="verse">31</span> Then the demons begged him, “If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.” <span class="verse">32</span> And he said, “Go!” So they came out and went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake and drowned in the water. <span class="verse">33</span> The herdsmen ran off, went into the town, and told everything that had happened to the demon-possessed men. <span class="verse">34</span> Then the entire town came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region. </p>
