<h1>Luke<br/>Chapter 9:18-27</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Peter’s Confession </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">18</span> Once when Jesus was praying by himself, and his disciples were nearby, he asked them, “Who do the crowds say that I am?” <span class="verse">19</span> They answered, “John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others that one of the prophets of long ago has risen.” <span class="verse">20</span> Then he said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered, “The Christ of God.” <span class="verse">21</span> But he forcefully commanded them not to tell this to anyone, <span class="verse">22</span> saying, “The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and experts in the law, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.” </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">A Call to Discipleship </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">23</span> Then he said to them all, “If anyone wants to become my follower, he must deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow me. <span class="verse">24</span> For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life because of me will save it. <span class="verse">25</span> For what does it benefit a person if he gains the whole world but loses or forfeits himself? <span class="verse">26</span> For whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of that person when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. <span class="verse">27</span> But I tell you most certainly, there are some standing here who will not experience death before they see the kingdom of God.” </p>
