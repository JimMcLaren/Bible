<p class="bodytext"><span class="verse">50</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> spoke to Moses in the rift valley plains of Moab along the Jordan, across from Jericho. He said: <span class="verse">51</span> “Speak to the Israelites and tell them, ‘When you have crossed the Jordan into the land of Canaan, <span class="verse">52</span> you must drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you. Destroy all their carved images, all their molten images, and demolish their high places. <span class="verse">53</span> You must dispossess the inhabitants of the land and live in it, for I have given you the land to possess it. <span class="verse">54</span> You must divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families. To a larger group you must give a larger inheritance, and to a smaller group you must give a smaller inheritance. Everyone’s inheritance must be in the place where his lot falls. You must inherit according to your ancestral tribes. <span class="verse">55</span> But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land before you, then those whom you allow to remain will be irritants in your eyes and thorns in your side, and will cause you trouble in the land where you will be living. <span class="verse">56</span> And what I intended to do to them I will do to you.’”</p>
