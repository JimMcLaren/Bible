<span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now this one endured this praiseworthy death. The third was brought along, and exhorted by many to taste and save his life.   
<span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>But he cried out and said, “Don’t you know that the father of those who are dead is my father also, and that the same mother bore me, and that I was brought up in the same way?   
<span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I don’t renounce the noble relationship of my kindred.   
<span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Now then, whatever instrument of vengeance you have, apply it to my body, for you aren’t able to touch my soul, even if you want to.”   
<span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But they, highly incensed at his boldness of speech, dislocated his hands and feet with racking engines, and wrenching them from their sockets, dismembered him.   
<span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>They dragged around his fingers, his arms, his legs, and his ankles.   
<span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Not being able by any means to strangle him, they tore off his skin, together with the extreme tips of his fingers, and then dragged him to the wheel,   
<span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>around which his vertebral joints were loosened, and he saw his own flesh torn to shreds, and streams of blood flowing from his entrails.   
<span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>When about to die, he said,   
<span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>“We, O accursed tyrant, suffer this for the sake of Divine education and virtue.   
<span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But you, for your impiety and blood shedding, will endure unceasing torments.”   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Thus having died worthily of his kindred, they dragged forward the fourth, saying,   
<span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>“Don’t share the madness of your kindred, but respect the king and save yourself.”   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But he said to them, “You don’t have a fire so scorching as to make me play the coward.   
<span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>By the blessed death of my kindred, and the eternal punishment of the tyrant, and the glorious life of the pious, I will not repudiate the noble brotherhood.   
<span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Invent, O tyrant, tortures, that you may learn, even through them, that I am the brother of those tormented before.”   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>When he had said this, the blood-thirsty, murderous, and unholy Antiochus ordered his tongue to be cut out.   
<span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But he said, “Even if you take away the organ of speech, God still hears the silent.   
<span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Behold, my tongue is extended, cut it off; for in spite of that you won’t silence our reasoning.   
<span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>We gladly lose our limbs on behalf of God.   
<span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But God will speedily find you, since you cut off the tongue, the instrument of divine melody.”   </div>
