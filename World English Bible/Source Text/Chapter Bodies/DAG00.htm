The Song of the Three Holy Children is an addition to
Daniel found in the Greek Septuagint but not found in the traditional Hebrew text of
Daniel. This portion is recognized as Deuterocanonical Scripture by the Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Russian Orthodox Churches. It is found inserted between Daniel 3:23 and Daniel 3:24 of the traditional Hebrew Bible. Here, the verses after 23 from the Hebrew Bible are numbered starting at 91 to make room for these verses.</a></div>
