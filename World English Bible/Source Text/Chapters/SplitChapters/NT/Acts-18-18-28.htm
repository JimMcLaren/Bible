<span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Paul, having stayed after this many more days, took his leave of the brothers,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*
<span class="popup">The word for “brothers” here and where the context allows may also be correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.”</span></a> and sailed from there for Syria, together with Priscilla and Aquila. He shaved his head in Cenchreae, for he had a vow.   
<span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>He came to Ephesus, and he left them there; but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.   
<span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>When they asked him to stay with them a longer time, he declined;   
<span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>but taking his leave of them, he said, “I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem, but I will return again to you if God wills.” Then he set sail from Ephesus.   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the assembly, and went down to Antioch.   
<span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Having spent some time there, he departed and went through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, in order, establishing all the disciples.   
<span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus. He was mighty in the Scriptures.   
<span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, although he knew only the baptism of John.   
<span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside, and explained to him the way of God more accurately.   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>When he had determined to pass over into Achaia, the brothers encouraged him; and wrote to the disciples to receive him. When he had come, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace;   
<span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>for he powerfully refuted the Jews, publicly showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.   </div>
