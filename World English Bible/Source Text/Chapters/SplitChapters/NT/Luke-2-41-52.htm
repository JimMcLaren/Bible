<span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>His parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover.   
<span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>When he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast;   
<span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. Joseph and his mother didn’t know it,   
<span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day’s journey; and they looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances.   
<span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>When they didn’t find him, they returned to Jerusalem, looking for him.   
<span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>After three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the middle of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions.   
<span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.   
<span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>When they saw him, they were astonished; and his mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us this way? Behold, your father and I were anxiously looking for you.”   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>He said to them, 
<span class='wj'>“Why were you looking for me? Didn’t you know that I must be in my Father’s house?”</span>   
<span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>They didn’t understand the saying which he spoke to them.   
<span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And he went down with them and came to Nazareth. He was subject to them, and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.   
<span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.   </div>
