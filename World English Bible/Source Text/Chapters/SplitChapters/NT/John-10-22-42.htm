<span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon’s porch.   
<span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The Jews therefore came around him and said to him, “How long will you hold us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.”   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Jesus answered them, 
<span class='wj'>“I told you, and you don’t believe. The works that I do in my Father’s name, these testify about me. </span>   
<span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>But you don’t believe, because you are not of my sheep, as I told you. </span>   
<span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. </span>   
<span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>I give eternal life to them. They will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. </span>   
<span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>My Father who has given them to me is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of my Father’s hand. </span>   
<span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>I and the Father are one.”</span>   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Therefore the Jews took up stones again to stone him.   
<span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Jesus answered them, 
<span class='wj'>“I have shown you many good works from my Father. For which of those works do you stone me?”</span>   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>The Jews answered him, “We don’t stone you for a good work, but for blasphemy, because you, being a man, make yourself God.”   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Jesus answered them, 
<span class='wj'>“Isn’t it written in your law, ‘I said, you are gods’?</span><a href="#FN6" class="notemark">✡
<span class="popup">Psalms 82:6</span></a>   
<span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture can’t be broken), </span>   
<span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, ‘You blaspheme,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’? </span>   
<span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>If I don’t do the works of my Father, don’t believe me. </span>   
<span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>But if I do them, though you don’t believe me, believe the works, that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.” </span>   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>They sought again to seize him, and he went out of their hand.   
<span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>He went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was baptizing at first, and he stayed there.   
<span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Many came to him. They said, “John indeed did no sign, but everything that John said about this man is true.”   
<span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Many believed in him there.   </div>
