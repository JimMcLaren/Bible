<span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>About eight days after these sayings, he took with him Peter, John, and James, and went up onto the mountain to pray.   
<span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>As he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became white and dazzling.   
<span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Behold, two men were talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah,   
<span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure,<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">§
<span class="popup">literally, “exodus”</span></a> which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him.   
<span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>As they were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let’s make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah,” not knowing what he said.   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>While he said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.   
<span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>A voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!”   
<span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>When the voice came, Jesus was found alone. They were silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.   
<span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Behold, a man from the crowd called out, saying, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only born<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">*
<span class="popup">The phrase “only born” is from the Greek word “μονογενη”, which is sometimes translated “only begotten” or “one and only”.</span></a> child.   
<span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Behold, a spirit takes him, he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he foams; and it hardly departs from him, bruising him severely.   
<span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>I begged your disciples to cast it out, and they couldn’t.”   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Jesus answered, 
<span class='wj'>“Faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.”</span>   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>While he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.   
<span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>They were all astonished at the majesty of God.  </div><div class='p'>But while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,   
<span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>“Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men.”</span>   
<span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>But they didn’t understand this saying. It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>An argument arose among them about which of them was the greatest.   
<span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Jesus, perceiving the reasoning of their hearts, took a little child, and set him by his side,   
<span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>and said to them, 
<span class='wj'>“Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me. Whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For whoever is least among you all, this one will be great.”</span>   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>John answered, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he doesn’t follow with us.”   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Jesus said to him, 
<span class='wj'>“Don’t forbid him, for he who is not against us is for us.”</span>   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>It came to pass, when the days were near that he should be taken up, he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem   
<span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>and sent messengers before his face. They went and entered into a village of the Samaritans, so as to prepare for him.   
<span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>They didn’t receive him, because he was traveling with his face set toward Jerusalem.   
<span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>When his disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, “Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky and destroy them, just as Elijah did?”   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>But he turned and rebuked them, 
<span class='wj'>“You don’t know of what kind of spirit you are. </span>   
<span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>For the Son of Man didn’t come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them.”</span>  </div><div class='p'>They went to another village.   
<span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>As they went on the way, a certain man said to him, “I want to follow you wherever you go, Lord.”   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>Jesus said to him, 
<span class='wj'>“The foxes have holes and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”</span>   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>He said to another, 
<span class='wj'>“Follow me!”</span>  </div><div class='p'>But he said, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.”   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>But Jesus said to him, 
<span class='wj'>“Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and announce God’s Kingdom.”</span>   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>Another also said, “I want to follow you, Lord, but first allow me to say good-bye to those who are at my house.”   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>But Jesus said to him, 
<span class='wj'>“No one, having put his hand to the plow and looking back, is fit for God’s Kingdom.”</span>   </div>
