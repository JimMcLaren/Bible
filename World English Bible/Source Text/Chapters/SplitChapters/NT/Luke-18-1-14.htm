<span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>He also spoke a parable to them that they must always pray and not give up,   
<span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>saying, 
<span class='wj'>“There was a judge in a certain city who didn’t fear God and didn’t respect man. </span>   
<span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>A widow was in that city, and she often came to him, saying, ‘Defend me from my adversary!’ </span>   
<span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>He wouldn’t for a while; but afterward he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God nor respect man, </span>   
<span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>yet because this widow bothers me, I will defend her, or else she will wear me out by her continual coming.’ ”</span>   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The Lord said, 
<span class='wj'>“Listen to what the unrighteous judge says. </span>   
<span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>Won’t God avenge his chosen ones who are crying out to him day and night, and yet he exercises patience with them? </span>   
<span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>I tell you that he will avenge them quickly. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?”</span>   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He also spoke this parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness, and who despised all others:   
<span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>“Two men went up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector. </span>   
<span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>The Pharisee stood and prayed by himself like this: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like the rest of men: extortionists, unrighteous, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. </span>   
<span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>I fast twice a week. I give tithes of all that I get.’ </span>   
<span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>But the tax collector, standing far away, wouldn’t even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his chest, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’ </span>   
<span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.”</span>   </div><div class='p'>
