<span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>After these things Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth.   
<span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>He found a certain Jew named Aquila, a man of Pontus by race, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome. He came to them,   
<span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>and because he practiced the same trade, he lived with them and worked, for by trade they were tent makers.   
<span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>He reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath and persuaded Jews and Greeks.   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>When Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was compelled by the Spirit, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.   
<span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>When they opposed him and blasphemed, he shook out his clothing and said to them, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am clean. From now on, I will go to the Gentiles!”   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He departed there and went into the house of a certain man named Justus, one who worshiped God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.   
<span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house. Many of the Corinthians, when they heard, believed and were baptized.   
<span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision, 
<span class='wj'>“Don’t be afraid, but speak and don’t be silent; </span>   
<span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many people in this city.”</span>   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>He lived there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.   
<span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat,   
<span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>saying, “This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.”   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, “If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked crime, you Jews, it would be reasonable that I should bear with you;   
<span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>but if they are questions about words and names and your own law, look to it yourselves. For I don’t want to be a judge of these matters.”   
<span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So he drove them from the judgment seat.   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then all the Greeks seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. Gallio didn’t care about any of these things.   </div><div class='p'>
