<span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>He said to the disciples, 
<span class='wj'>“It is impossible that no occasions of stumbling should come, but woe to him through whom they come! </span>   
<span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble. </span>   
<span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>Be careful. If your brother sins against you, rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him. </span>   
<span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>If he sins against you seven times in the day, and seven times returns, saying, ‘I repent,’ you shall forgive him.”</span>   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith.”   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The Lord said, 
<span class='wj'>“If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you would tell this sycamore tree, ‘Be uprooted and be planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you. </span>   
<span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>But who is there among you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will say when he comes in from the field, ‘Come immediately and sit down at the table’? </span>   
<span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>Wouldn’t he rather tell him, ‘Prepare my supper, clothe yourself properly, and serve me while I eat and drink. Afterward you shall eat and drink’? </span>   
<span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded? I think not. </span>   
<span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>Even so you also, when you have done all the things that are commanded you, say, ‘We are unworthy servants. We have done our duty.’ ” </span>   </div><div class='p'>
