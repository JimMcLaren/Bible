<span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>When he came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.   
<span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Behold, a leper came to him and worshiped him, saying, “Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.”   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, 
<span class='wj'>“I want to. Be made clean.”</span> Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.   
<span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Jesus said to him, 
<span class='wj'>“See that you tell nobody; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”</span>   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>When he came into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking him for help,   
<span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>saying, “Lord, my servant lies in the house paralyzed, grievously tormented.”   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Jesus said to him, 
<span class='wj'>“I will come and heal him.”</span>   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The centurion answered, “Lord, I’m not worthy for you to come under my roof. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed.   
<span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For I am also a man under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and tell another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and tell my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>When Jesus heard it, he marveled and said to those who followed, 
<span class='wj'>“Most certainly I tell you, I haven’t found so great a faith, not even in Israel. </span>   
<span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven, </span>   
<span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>
<span class='wj'>but the children of the Kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”</span>   
<span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Jesus said to the centurion, 
<span class='wj'>“Go your way. Let it be done for you as you have believed.”</span> His servant was healed in that hour.   </div><div class='p'>
