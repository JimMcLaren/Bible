<span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah; and he reigned over Israel two years.   
<span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>He did that which was evil in the LORD’s sight, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin.   
<span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha struck him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel were besieging Gibbethon.   
<span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha killed him and reigned in his place.   
<span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>As soon as he was king, he struck all the house of Jeroboam. He didn’t leave to Jeroboam any who breathed, until he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite;   
<span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and with which he made Israel to sin, because of his provocation with which he provoked the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger.   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?   
<span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah began to reign over all Israel in Tirzah for twenty-four years.   
<span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>He did that which was evil in the LORD’s sight, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin.   </div>
