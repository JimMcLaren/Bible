<span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and spoke, saying, “Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.   
<span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led Israel out and in. The LORD said to you, ‘You will be shepherd of my people Israel, and you will be prince over Israel.’ ”   
<span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel.   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.   
<span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying, “The blind and the lame will keep you out of here,” thinking, “David can’t come in here.”   
<span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion. This is David’s city.   
<span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>David said on that day, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites, let him go up to the watercourse and strike those lame and blind, who are hated by David’s soul.” Therefore they say, “The blind and the lame can’t come into the house.”   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>David lived in the stronghold, and called it David’s city. David built around from Millo and inward.   
<span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>David grew greater and greater, for the LORD, the God of Armies, was with him.   
<span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, with cedar trees, carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house.   
<span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel’s sake.   </div><div class='p'> 
<span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>David took more concubines and wives for himself out of Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron; and more sons and daughters were born to David.   
<span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>These are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,   
<span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,   
<span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.   </div><div class='p'>
