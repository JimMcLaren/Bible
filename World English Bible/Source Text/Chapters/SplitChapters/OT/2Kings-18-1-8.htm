<span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.   
<span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah.   
<span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>He did that which was right in the LORD’s eyes, according to all that David his father had done.   
<span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>He removed the high places, broke the pillars, and cut down the Asherah. He also broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made, because in those days the children of Israel burned incense to it; and he called it Nehushtan.   
<span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>He trusted in the LORD, the God of Israel, so that after him was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, nor among them that were before him.   
<span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For he joined with the LORD. He didn’t depart from following him, but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses.   
<span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The LORD was with him. Wherever he went, he prospered. He rebelled against the king of Assyria, and didn’t serve him.   
<span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>He struck the Philistines to Gaza and its borders, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city.   </div><div class='p'>
